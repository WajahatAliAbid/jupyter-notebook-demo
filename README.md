# My First Jupyter Notebook
This is my first Jupyter Notebook using Python3. I will be learning to utilize this with bunch of different languages.


```python
print("Hello World")
```



## Using Pandas

I learned to use the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library for python to analyse the data for pokemon. You can check my Jupyter notebook [here](./pandas_demo.ipynb).
